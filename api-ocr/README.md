# OCR API using Gradio
Gradio provides useful features which enable rapid prototyping for our use case:
- management of long-running tasks
  - using task queuing
  - and client updates with Server-Side Events
- a clean HTTP API which is usable with JS, Python and plain CURL
- a nice GUI for testing
- stability and support
